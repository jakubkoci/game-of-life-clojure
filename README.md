# game-of-life-clojure

Conwey's game of life implemented in Clojure. There is not GUI yet, I played around with Humble UI but wasn't able to make any progress so far. You can run it in command line though.

## Run CLI

```sh
clj -M -m game-of-life-clojure.cli
```

## Run Tests

```sh
clj -X:test
```

## Run REPL

I don't know how to run repl server without running the user namespace that opens the window as the following command. `clj -M:dev` opens just regular repl I'm not able to connect to from editor.

```sh
clj -M:dev -m user
```
